# Pong Game using C++ and Raylib

## 📌 Overview
This project is a modern implementation of the classic Pong game, developed using **C++** and the **Raylib** graphics library. The game follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to ensure modularity, scalability, and efficient code management.

## 🎮 Features
- **Smooth 2D Gameplay:** Engaging Pong game with precise paddle control.
- **AI-Powered Opponent:** The computer-controlled paddle dynamically tracks the ball.
- **Real-Time Physics:** Collision detection for accurate ball and paddle interactions.
- **Audio Effects:** Sound effects for paddle hits and scoring events.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The ball speed increases as the game progresses.
- **Optimized User Controls:** Seamless paddle movement using keyboard inputs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** – Core programming language.
- **Raylib** – Lightweight graphics and audio handling.
- **VS Code** – Primary development environment.
- **Raylib Audio Module** – Used for integrating sound effects.
